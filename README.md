# Childhood SEP-and-biological-age-Colombia-

This repository contents dataframes, codes, results, and supplementary material of the research project "Social patterning of chronic cardiometabolic conditions and biological aging using SABE aging survey data in Colombian population".

Please note that there are five codes in this repository covering five main steps described below:

Code 1. Data manipulation steps and imputation missing data. This covers than initial cleaning and data exploration, understanding the missing value patterns, and apply Missing completely at random (MCAR) imputation procedures to alternative SABE datasets, and apply case complete strategy (excluding NA). In total, four SABE datasets were tested in this analysis.

Code 2. Transformation data. This Markdown covers tidying data, data processing, and preparation for analysis. This step includes: re-coding, standardizing values, and creating new functions, and combination of vectors not present in the data and computing frequency tables.

Code 3. Clustering analsysis and Latent Class Analysis (LCA): apply two different approaches to find the best fit model of unobservable groups in the data.

Code 4. Hypothesis testing, matrix correlations, and data visualization. This Markdown covers basic statistics to summarise the data (Mean, Median, Mode, Outliers, errors), describe distribution and spreading of the data (plotting charts), measure the variability in the data (inter-quartile range, variance, SD), quantify the strength of associations between variables (Pearson correlation coefficient), and asking questions about data (correlation matrices).

Code 5. Quantification of Biological Age BA Calculation. Klemera-Doubal Method (KDM) Biological Age and Homeostatict Dysregulation (HD) algorithms were estimated using BioAge package. A working set of ten biological markers were compute in the BAA.

Code 5. Regression tables and predictor models: ACE-BA, BA-disease, and ACE-disease.

Code 6. Mediation analysis by biological age. Direct and indirect effects of ACE and BA on outcomes.
